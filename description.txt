A mod that features 4 pistons : 
-The normal one that can only push at most 10 blocks for one tile
-The sticky one that can also pull the block at its end
-The long one is a bit stronger and can push for a distance of 2 tiles at once
-The strong one is a Hardmode variant but an push blocks for a distance of 100 tiles

Theses pistons are multiplayer friendly.
The sprites aren't great though, you're welcome to propose some better ones on GitHub.
